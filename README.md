# MinecraftMod

This is a project I created in the first year of the IMS. I was and still am a big fan of the game Minecraft and it marked my chieldhood pretty gravely. That is why I decided to make a Minecraft Mod as a project as I wanted to expand my knowledge in this field. It was my first ever project in which I used Java, because all the way up until that point we used to programm with C# so this was a completely new experience for me.
